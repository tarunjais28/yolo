# YOLO
A high-stakes, winner-takes-all battle royale. In YOLO, STAKES add crypto to a shared pot — and the more they add, the greater their chance of winning. Essentially, a player’s odds are proportionate to their share of the total pot.

When deposits close, the wheel spins, before landing on a player. That lucky guy takes home everything in the pot (minus a small fee), while the losers go home empty-handed.
